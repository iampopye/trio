## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Review the existing changes and then create a git commit following the conventional commit format. If you think there are more than one distinct change you can create multiple commits.
